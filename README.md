# CryptoForecasting

## Overview
CryptoForecasting is a web-based cryptocurrency price prediction system integrating multiple machine learning models, including LSTM, SVR, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression. The project leverages real-time and historical data to forecast crypto price movements with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Multi-Model Prediction**: Implements LSTM, SVR, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression models for precise forecasting.
- **Real-Time Market Tracking**: Fetches live data using Yahoo Finance for up-to-date predictions.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Processes over 5 million historical price data points with PostgreSQL, Pandas, and NumPy.
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved an RMSE of 1.12 and 88% accuracy by refining feature selection and data scaling.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed using Streamlit to analyze trends, compare models, and export data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance
